Not just 'sites' anymore: the power of the web today
====================================================

Slides for a talk about the great beauty of frontend. # slides, about 30 minutes.

Originally conceived for the [Codemotion DevCast](https://live.codemotion.com/devcast/la-grande-bellezza-del-frontend) (in Italian) online, 2021-10-12.

Built on top of [P-Slides](https://github.com/MaxArt2501/p-slides)!

## Building

Node.js 10.x is required (actually it could work in Node 8 - haven't checked).

To start the presentation in development mode:

1. Clone the repository;
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run serve`

Or `npm run build` to just build it, then serve `/public` with your HTTP server of choice.

## Tests

... what?
